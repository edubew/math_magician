        Mathematics as an expression of the human mind reflects the active will,
        the contemplative reason, and the desire for aesthetic perfection. Its
        basic elements are logic and intuition, analysis and construction,
        generality and individuality. Richard Courant

        Todays scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and
        they wander off through equation after equation, and eventually build a
        structure which has no relation to reality. Nikola Tesla
